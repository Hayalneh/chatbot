 and berries offer a range of vitamins and antioxidants. Vegetables such as carrots, broccoli, spinach, and sweet potatoes provide essential nutrients and fiber. 
Protein-rich options include eggs, chicken, fish, legumes, and tofu, which are vital for muscle growth and repair. 
Dairy products like milk, yogurt, and cheese are good sources of calcium and protein. Whole grains like oats, quinoa, and whole wheat bread offer complex carbohydrates and fiber. 
Additionally, healthy fats can be obtained from foods like avocado, nuts, and nut butter, providing essential fatty acids. 
By including these diverse food items, individuals can create a balanced and nourishing eating plan.
